**Overview**

Analyze data for a ride share company PyBer and calculate metrics as they relate to three different types of cities. The datasets were separated by urban, suburban, and rural cities to show metrics as they related to total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and total number of drivers. A dataframe was also created to show a weekly breakdown from January 1st 2019 to April 29th 2019.

**Summary**
---
---
Some recommendations would be to find an incentive to get more of the Urban drivers out to either the Suburban or Rural areas. With Urban drivers at the low end of average fares it is likely they wouldn't be able to live off the low pay and getting them outside of their city can help boost their average and still have good revenue within the city for PyBer. Taking some time to invest in Rural cities to get more rides going would also be a good move. Finding a way to increase rides either through advertisements or community outreach could prove Rural cities to be a large money maker for both PyBer and drivers, an increase in Rural rides could also prove to be beneficial in getting Urban drivers outside of their area and take advantage of the increase.
